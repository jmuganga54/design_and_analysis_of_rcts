# Course Overview  
## Design and Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials

---

## 1. Introduction

This course focuses on the **design, analysis, and interpretation of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)** for evaluating health interventions.

In this unit, you will find:

- An introduction to the course
- The structure of course materials and activities
- Expectations for engagement and independent study
- Details of in-person sessions and course team interaction

---

## 2. Aims of the Course

This course unit concerns the **design, analysis, and interpretation of Randomised Controlled Trials** for evaluating health interventions.

The central goal is to understand how to generate reliable evidence about whether health interventions truly work.

## 3. Why This Course Matters

A wide range of health interventions are used to improve patient outcomes, including:

- Drugs  
- Surgical procedures  
- Artificial intelligence algorithms  
- Mental health therapies  

If these interventions are not evaluated properly, we risk:

- Using treatments that do not work  
- Using treatments that cause harm  
- Making decisions based on biased evidence  

Although large datasets are increasingly available, non-randomised studies are vulnerable to bias. Randomised Controlled Trials offer a more robust method for evaluating interventions — but only when they are **properly designed, analysed, and interpreted**.

This course develops those skills.

## 4. Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, students should be able to:

### 1. Apply Appropriate Statistical Methods
Recognise, choose, and apply statistical methods suitable for a trial based on its:
- Design  
- Objectives  
- Outcome measures  

---

### 2. Critically Appraise Randomised Controlled Trials
Critically evaluate the:
- Design  
- Analysis  
- Interpretation  

With specific attention to **minimising bias**.

---

### 3. Analyse Data from Different RCT Designs
Analyse and interpret data from RCTs including:

- Parallel designs  
- Cluster designs  
- Superiority trials  
- Non-inferiority trials  
- Equivalence trials  

---

### 4. Choose and Justify Trial Design
Select and justify:

- Appropriate trial design  
- Sample size calculations  
- Design choices for continuous or binary outcomes  

---

## 5. Strategic Perspective

This course is not only about running statistical models.

It is about:

- Designing fair comparisons  
- Minimising bias before data collection  
- Interpreting results responsibly  
- Understanding the limits of evidence  

The strength of a Randomised Controlled Trial lies in its **design**, not its complexity.

---

## Personal Revision Reminder

Design determines validity.  
Randomisation protects against confounding.  
Analysis cannot rescue poor design.  
Interpretation must be careful and honest.
