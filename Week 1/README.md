# Week 1 – Design and Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
## Revision Notes

---

## 1. Core Question

The fundamental question in clinical research:

**Does this treatment improve outcomes compared to what would have happened otherwise?**

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are designed to estimate the causal effect of a treatment.

---

## 2. Key Definitions

### Treatment Group
Participants who receive the intervention under investigation.

### Control Group
Participants used for comparison.  
May receive:
- Standard of care  
- Usual practice  
- Placebo  
- No treatment (if appropriate)

Control group does not automatically mean no treatment.

### Outcome
A measurable indicator of patient health after treatment.

Examples:
- Live birth  
- Mortality  
- Blood pressure  
- Symptom reduction  

### Primary Outcome
The main outcome the study is designed to evaluate.

### Secondary Outcomes
Additional outcomes measured to provide broader understanding.

## 3. The Counterfactual Problem

For any individual, we can observe:

- Outcome under treatment  
OR  
- Outcome under control  

We cannot observe both.

The unobserved scenario is called the counterfactual.

RCTs estimate the difference between these two potential outcomes at the population level.

---

## 4. Treatment Effect

Treatment Effect =  
Outcome under treatment − Outcome under control

Because we cannot observe both for one individual, we estimate:

The Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

RCTs provide an unbiased estimate of the ATE.

---

## 5. Why Control Groups Are Essential

Without a control group:
- We cannot determine what would have happened without treatment.
- Improvement may be due to natural recovery.
- It may be due to regression to the mean.
- It may be due to time or other external factors.

Case series cannot establish causality.

---

## 6. Experimental vs Observational Studies

### Experimental Studies
Researcher assigns treatment.

If assignment is random → Randomized Controlled Trial.

### Observational Studies
Researcher does not assign treatment.
Treatment occurs naturally in practice.

Non-randomized studies of interventions may be observational or experimental without randomization.

---

## 7. Bias

Bias = systematic distortion of the estimated treatment effect.

If bias exists, repeated studies would give results consistently too high, too low, or in the wrong direction.

Bias can arise from:
- Poor design  
- Poor analysis  

---

## 8. Confounding

Confounding occurs when a third variable influences both:
- Treatment assignment  
- Outcome  

Example: Age may influence treatment choice and probability of recovery.

Randomization protects against confounding.

---

## 9. Why Randomization Is Powerful

Random allocation:
- Breaks the link between patient characteristics and treatment assignment  
- Balances both measured and unmeasured confounders (in expectation)  
- Ensures group differences are random rather than systematic  

Randomization does not require perfect balance.  
It requires that any imbalance is random.

---

## 10. Adjustment in Non-Randomized Studies

Statistical methods such as regression or propensity scores can adjust for measured confounders.

They cannot adjust for unmeasured confounders.

Large sample size does not remove confounding.

Big data does not fix poor design.

---

## 11. Random Sampling vs Randomization

These are different concepts.

Random Sampling:
Selecting participants randomly from a population.
Improves generalizability.

Randomization:
Randomly assigning treatment within a study.
Improves internal validity.

RCTs usually have randomization but not random sampling.

---

## 12. Recruitment and Eligibility

Trials define:

### Inclusion Criteria
Characteristics required to participate.

### Exclusion Criteria
Characteristics that prevent participation.

Participants must:
- Meet eligibility criteria  
- Provide informed consent  

---

## 13. Ethical Principles in RCTs

### Equipoise
There must be genuine uncertainty about which treatment is better.

### Informed Consent
Participants must understand risks and agree voluntarily.

### Right to Withdraw
Participants may leave at any time without penalty.

### Oversight
Trials require:
- Ethics committee approval  
- Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
- Trial Steering Committee

## 14. Strategic Lessons from Week 1

1. Design determines validity.  
2. Control groups are essential for causal inference.  
3. Randomization protects against confounding.  
4. Large datasets cannot rescue biased design.  
5. Random sampling and randomization are different.  
6. Ethics is foundational to clinical research.

## Quick Revision Reminder

Design first.  
Comparison is everything.  
Randomization protects validity.  
Analysis cannot rescue poor design.
